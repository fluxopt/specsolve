"""The examples in the docs, checked against the code.

Every example here was wrong at some point: ``sps.write_lp`` never existed, a
dimension index was passed as a bare ``RangeIndex`` where the streaming lane
wants an index entry in ``sources``, the ``piecewise:`` block carried a sign on three
links while the prose two lines below said a sign needs exactly two, and four
module docstrings leaked the engine by never closing the ``Result``. Three
separate hand sweeps found three separate batches, which is the argument for
this file: an example nobody runs is a claim nobody checked.

Coverage cannot silently drop, and that claim needs two guards, not one.
:func:`test_every_block_is_covered` polices blocks that were *matched*; it is
blind to a fence the regex failed to recognise, which is the same silent loss
by another route. :func:`test_every_fence_is_seen` closes that by scanning for
fences language-agnostically and asserting every ``python``/``yaml`` one was
matched — so an unclosed fence, or a style the regex has not learned, fails
loudly instead of quietly shrinking the sweep.

A block may therefore be indented inside a list item, carry an info string
after the language (``python title="a.py"``), or use tilde fences — all are
matched, and the code is dedented before parsing.

Annotations go in an HTML comment on the line before the fence, so they are
invisible in rendered markdown:

    <!-- doctest: wrap=constraints -->   nest the block under that schema key
    <!-- doctest: skip -->               excluded, and the reason belongs in a comment

A YAML block with no annotation is validated whole, which means it must
resolve its own cross-references: a lone ``parameters:`` section naming a
dimension it does not declare is a failure, and the fix is usually ``wrap=``
or ``skip`` rather than a bigger example.

In module docstrings, an example is an indented run introduced by ``::`` —
the reST literal-block marker. Guessing instead ("a run that mentions ``sps.``")
reads an indented English sentence as code and fails it as a syntax error,
which would stop prose from naming the API it documents.
