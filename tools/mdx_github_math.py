"""GitHub's verbatim inline math, as a Markdown extension the site enables.

``mathspec.to_markdown`` prints GitHub-flavoured Markdown, where inline math
is delimited ``$`…`$`` so that GitHub hands the span to MathJax untouched.
Arithmatex has no syntax for it: python-markdown's own inline code processor
claims the backtick span first. So the site rewrites the pair into the ``$…$``
arithmatex reads, and nothing is escaped away on the way in.
