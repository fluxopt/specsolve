# Choosing a solver

How to solve on a solver other than HiGHS, pass it options, or write the model
to a file for a solver specsolve does not run. HiGHS ships with specsolve and
is the default. Nothing in the spec names a solver, so the call chooses one.

## See which solvers this build has

Name a solver that does not exist, and the refusal lists the ones that do.
This block runs when the site is built, so the list is this commit's:

```python exec="true" source="material-block" result="text"
import specsolve as sps

try:
    sps.solve('examples/dispatch.yaml', {}, solver_name='cplex')
except sps.SpecsolveError as exc:
    print(exc)
```

The name is checked before any data is attached.

## Install the solver

Every solver except HiGHS comes with the extra of the same name:

```bash
pip install "specsolve[gurobi]"
```

A name the build knows, but whose package is not installed, raises
`ModuleNotFoundError` with the `pip install` line to run.

## Name it in the call

`solver_name=` goes on [`solve`](../reference/api.md#specsolve.solve),
[`Model.solve`](../reference/api.md#specsolve.Model.solve) and
[`solve_over`](../reference/sweeps.md):

```python
result = sps.solve('dispatch.yaml', sources, solver_name='gurobi')
```

## Pass solver options

`solver_options=` goes to the solver verbatim, in its own vocabulary. A time
limit is `time_limit` on HiGHS and `TimeLimit` on Gurobi:

```python
result = sps.solve('dispatch.yaml', sources, solver_name='gurobi', solver_options={'TimeLimit': 60})
```

## Check a spec against a solver before solving

Solvers take different constructs: HiGHS has no SOS sets, for example.
`check` with `sink=` refuses a spec the solver cannot take, and needs no data:

```python
sps.check('dispatch.yaml', sink='highs')
```

The refusal names the solvers that do take the construct. The full table is
[what each sink takes](../reference/api.md#what-each-sink-takes).

## Write the model to a file

For a solver or tool that specsolve does not run, write the model. The suffix
picks the format, and this build writes `.lp` and `.mps`:

```python
sps.write('dispatch.yaml', sources, 'dispatch.lp')
```

The two formats carry different constructs: MPS has no quadratic objective or
indicator, for example. The table above covers both.
